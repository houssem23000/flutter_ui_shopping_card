This Ui focuss on:
- sreen adaptability
- Modular code 
- Animation

**Note 1:** This a project that was focussing on a new way of organising my code, It is well commented, however I did not use any state manager. It was not my goal. As far as the beautiful animations are concerned, maybe(I am not sure though, it would have been better if I used an AnimationBuilder)

**Note 2:** There is a buch of TODO ( 7 in total  ): these are just the small things i did not want to do. eg: getting the battery level or the current time etc.. You can easily add them if you like

**Note 3:** If you like my work and want to see more, you can follow me on [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/emilecode/ "my Instagram")

**Note 4:**  There are two classes named SlidingText and Widget animator; These are **UNSTABLE AND NOT YET RELEASED PACKAGE** that I am working on, please do not copy these files until they're released

Here is a Gif showing some animations in action
